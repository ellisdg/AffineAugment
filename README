# AffineAugment
BMI 8400 Final Project
David Ellis

AffineAugment is a Python library for augmenting 3D medical images using affine transformations.

## Files
* `affine.py` contains the functions to generate the affine transformations.
* `augment.py` contains the functions to apply the affine augmentations to the images.
* `test/test_augment.py` contains the unit test that compares a combined augmentation using my code and MONAI's code.
* `test/test_transforms.py` contains unit tests for testing the affine transformations against MONAI's tranformations.
* `preprocess.py` contains the code to crop the input images into images that will fit into the network.
* `make_examples.py` contains the code to generate the examples of the augmentations that I used in my presentation.
* `plot_comparisons.py` contains the code to generate the boxplots comparing step-wise augmentations and combined augmentations.
* `plot_training_results.py` contains the code to generate the plots of the training results.
* `train_model.py` contains the code to train the model. The arguments to this script determine whether the MONAI augmentation or my augmentation will be used for training.
* `results/` contains the results files and plots from model training and comparison between augmentation methods.
* `data/` contains some example data as well as the augmented examples generated by `make_examples.py`.
* `.requirements.txt` contains the required packages for this project.

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/AffineAugment
